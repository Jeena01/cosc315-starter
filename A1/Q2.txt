Provide your answer for Q2 here:
Part A:
calloc returns a buffer initialized with 0 whereas malloc returns a pointer to a memory space of specified size.
calloc initializes and malloc doesnt.
malloc takes one argument(number of bytes to allocate) and calloc takes two(number of blocks, number of bytes per block)

Part B:

malloc is faster as calloc needs to initialize the memory location allocated.

void *malloc(size_t size);
void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
